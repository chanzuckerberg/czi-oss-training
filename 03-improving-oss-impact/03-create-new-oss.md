## New OSS Project Motivations ‚ö°Ô∏è

New projects are key to innovation in open source. Projects that provide brand new solutions, address critical gaps in current tools, and provide competitive alternatives help our ecosystem grow. As we‚Äôll discuss in this section, there are many situations where the best corporate open source partnership involves creating new open source projects. At the same time, it can also be detrimental to the corporation and the community if the new project is not created sustainably.

Consider the following before creating a new open source project or open sourcing an internal tool for a potential software solution:

- **Is the project idea beneficial to a substantial community of users?** If created with org-specific assumptions or for proprietary integrations, the project will be open source in legality but not in spirit.
- **Is there an existing community OSS project that implements a similar solution?** You should always evaluate contributing improvements to existing projects before starting new ones to avoid duplicated effort. Note that sometimes existing projects have foundational limitations and massive technical debt, where it‚Äôs better to start a project with better foundations.
- **What is your core motivation to develop this project under an open source license?** If the new open source project is created _solely_ for marketing purposes[^1] or with the intention to maintain corporate control over the project, it‚Äôs unlikely to gain serious community adoption over the long-term. The project should be useful the community, motivation synergetic with the community and are you willing to be transparent about this?
- **Can you dedicate resources to build and maintain the project sustainably?** OSS projects require financial support and contributor expertise to see the project through various stages of the life cycle, especially for long-term maintenance. You can‚Äôt rely on the volunteer community without investing in community building first. A commitment of resources from the beginning will help you plan for sustainability and avoid creating abandonware.
- **Are you prepared to collaborate with the open source community?** New projects don‚Äôt have strict community-first guidelines during initial development, but healthy projects include upstream contributions and integrations with community projects. You need to be good corporate citizens while interacting with the OSS community which can be achieved by educating your team.

The following sections detail some important stages of developing a new open source project following the [OSS Life Cycle]. They assume you have identified the core value of your project, discussed corporate motivations, procured resource, and onboarded a team of initial contributors.

## Preliminary Considerations üß±

- **Open Source Values:** Discuss and document some principles for your corporate open source partnership like, building for interoperability, [transparent communication], and more.
- **User Workflows:** Like in any software development project, think about potential users, their workflows, their needs and pain points. Additionally, consider the open source alignment and expectation of individuals and corporate users of your project.
- **Project Roadmap:** Define a well-structured roadmap that balances both organization goals and open source community goals. Outline the project's milestones, features, and anticipated releases, and offer a direction for the project's evolution to contributors and potential users.
- **Preliminary Governance:** Discuss potential open source governance strategies like including corporate stakeholders in project leadership, having a community-focused advisory board, setting up to join a community organization or federation in the future, and more because it influences initial development practices.
- **Licenses and CLAs:** Select an appropriate [OSI-approved open source license] to dictate how the project can be used and distributed. The license can be chosen based on organizational policy, open source values, and motivations [^2]. Corporations must also establish Contributor License Agreements (CLAs) to govern contributions, ensuring that all contributors grant the necessary permissions for their contributions to be included in the project.
  [^2]: There have been several recent instances of corporate-backed software licensed under Business Source License (BUSL) or custom licenses. While these licenses provide restricted access to the use, modification, and re-distribution, they are not **open source** by definition.
- **Stakeholder Review:** Garner input from key stakeholders, including leadership, legal and compliance, software security, and marketing teams, to ensures the project aligns with the company's strategic vision and regulatory policies.
- **Project management:** Create initial project repositories, set up a documentation framework, and populate the project management space with roadmap tasks.
