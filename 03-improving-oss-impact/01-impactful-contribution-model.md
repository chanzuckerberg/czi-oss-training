## Where to start? Defining your open source goals üéØ

The previous Modules have introduced you to the world of open source and different ways to participate in OSS. [Module 02](../02-participating-in-oss/README.md) has also highlighted some motivations individuals and organizations have to participate in open source communities as well as some practical recommendations on how to get started and align with the community along the way.

As you have gathered from the previous modules, building good, long-lasting relationships with the ecosystem can be extremely valuable for your organization and employees. This chapter will introduce a number of guidelines for you to overcome some challenges you might encounter when participating in open source communities.

### üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Learner checkpoint

Does everyone in your organization or team:

- know what licenses they can use to create or consume products?
- know if you have policies on releasing code as open source?
- know who to contact if they have questions about open source?

### Defining an open source strategy

Organizations need common maps to navigate the complex open source ecosystems. Such maps provide everyone in the organization with a clear set of expectations, processes, and policies to guide, support, measure, and recognize their open source contributions.
Your (organization's) open source strategy connects the plans and processes for managing, participating in, and creating OSS within your organization and aligns them with your organization goals and mission.
Having a clear, and documented open source strategy can:

- help gain leadership's buy-in and support
- improve efficiency and mitigate risks
- help facilitate decision-making across teams and organization's verticals
- explain and clarify your organization's approach to open source in general
- clarify where and why your organization invests in community-driven projects, external R&D, and when to focus on internal efforts and value differentiation

The following sections will help you define or clarify your existing open source strategy.

1. Understand the why of your organization.

   Before you start defining your open source strategy, it is important to understand the why of your organization.

   - Why does your organization exist?
   - What is your organization's mission?
   - What are your organization's goals?
   - What are your organization's values?
   - How do you measure success within your organization?
   - Who benefits from the work your organization does?

2. Identify how open source contributes to your organization's goals.

   Once you have a clear understanding of your organization's mission, goals, and values, you can start aligning your open source strategy with your organization's goals.

   > **Important**
   > The most important question to ask yourself is: **How does open source help your organization achieve its goals and fulfill its mission?**

   For example if your organization's goal is to "[enable the universal and immediate open sharing of all scientific knowledge, processes, and outputs](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/open-science/)" then you can directly tie the principles of Open Research and Open Source introduced in [Module 01](../01-intro-to-os/README.md) to your organization's goals. Thus ensuring the long-term and sustainability of the scientific open source ecosystem is essential for your organization's success.

   Some questions you should be asking at this point are:

   - Where does the organization use open source?
   - What of our goals heavily rely on open source?
   - Where are we in our open source journey? (consumer, participant, contributor, leader)

3. Decide on and document your open source strategy.
   Your open source strategy should connect the plans for managing, participating in, and creating open source software.

4. Implement your open source strategy.
   Depending on where your organization is within its open source journey, it might be best to embrace a phased approach to a strategy implementation, starting by focusing on its short-to-medium term goals and reevaluate and adjust over time.

### Components of an open source strategy

Your organization strategy will act as the reference or source of truth for open policies, best practices, and processes. As such, it should be understandable and accessible by everyone within your organization.

At the minimum your strategy should contain:

1. Guiding principles
   1. your organization's approach to open source and the purpose behind your strategy
   2. What does success look like for your organization, and how does open source contributes to this success?
2. Expectations for:
   1. how people should **consume** open source software. This covers items such as licensing, acceptance, vetting, or exception policies, overall stance towards open source development
   2. how people should contribute to open source and projects or ecosystems critical to your organization goals
   3. how people should develop and release open source projects
   4. overall open source practices people should observe.
3. Strategy for:
   1. building open source platforms and tools
   2. building with open source
4. Policies and other guidelines relevant to OSS such as
   1. Data and supply chain security
   2. Open Source license compliance
   3. Branding and IP guidelines
   4. Starting a new open source project or opening source code
   5. Community standards and repository quality/structure
   6. Community interaction
