## Learning Objectives 🧠

<!-- TODO -->

## Defining your open source goals and strategy 🎯

The previous Modules have introduced you to the world of open source and different ways to participate in OSS. [Module 02](../02-participating-in-oss/README.md) has also highlighted some motivations individuals and organizations have to participate in open source communities as well as some practical recommendations on how to get started and align with the community along the way.

As you have gathered from the previous modules, building good, long-lasting relationships with the ecosystem can be extremely valuable for your organization and employees. This chapter will introduce a number of guidelines for you to overcome some challenges you might encounter when participating in open source communities.

### 🙋🏽‍♀️ Learner checkpoint

Does everyone in your organization or team:

- know what licenses they can use to create or consume products?
- know if you have policies on releasing code as open source?
- know who to contact if they have questions about open source?

### Setting an open source strategy

Organizations need common maps to navigate the complex open source ecosystems. Such maps provide everyone in the organization with a clear set of expectations, processes, and policies to guide, support, measure, and recognize their open source contributions.
Your (organization's) open source strategy connects the plans and processes for managing, participating in, and creating OSS within your organization and aligns them with your organization goals and mission.
Having a clear, and documented open source strategy can:

- help gain leadership's buy-in and support
- improve efficiency and mitigate risks
- help facilitate decision-making across teams and organization's verticals
- explain and clarify your organization's approach to open source in general
- clarify where and why your organization invests in community-driven projects, external R&D, and when to focus on internal efforts and value differentiation

The following sections will help you define or clarify your existing open source strategy.

#### 0. Understand the why of your organization

Before you start defining your open source strategy, it is important to understand the why of your organization.

- Why does your organization exist?
- What is your organization's mission?
- What are your organization's goals?
- What are your organization's values?
- How do you measure success within your organization?
- Who benefits from the work your organization does?

#### 1. Align your organization's goals with your open source strategy

Once you have a clear understanding of your organization's mission, goals, and values, you can start aligning your open source strategy with your organization's goals.

> **Important**
> The most important question to ask yourself is: **How does open source help your organization achieve its goals and fulfill its mission?**

For example if your organization's goal is to "[enable the universal and immediate open sharing of all scientific knowledge, processes, and outputs](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/open-science/)" then you can directly tie the principles of Open Research and Open Source introduced in [Module 01](../01-intro-to-os/README.md) to your organization's goals. Thus ensuring the long-term and sustainability of the scientific open source ecosystem is essential for your organization's success.
