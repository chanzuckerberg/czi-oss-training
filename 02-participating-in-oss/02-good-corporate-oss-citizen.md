- Understand the life cycle of an open source project and how to set up the project for long term sustainability

## OSS Project Life Cycle ðŸ¦‹

Understanding the life cycle of an open source project helps corporate sponsors extend the right kind of support at the right time. Although every project has a unique trajectory, we can outline some common themes which can be used to identify the state an needs of any project.

An OSS project can go through the following stages, but the depth and duration of each stage will vary:

Before delving into the details of each stage, let's discuss an important aspect of the life cycle: **Sustainability**.

### Sustainability

By definition, OSS projects give everyone the freedom to use, modify, and re-distribute the software, and it's often also free of cost. This is a key reason why OSS is the foundation of our digital infrastructure. At the same time, with so many critical components and for-profit organizations relying on OSS, it can quickly lead to volunteer burnout if users don't invest back in the OSS ecosystem.

An open source project is _sustainable_ if it can support itself. Sustainability in OSS widely focuses on financial sustainability, but practically, it also includes areas like community health.

Common strategies for financial sustainability of OSS software include:

- Corporate license fees
- Parallel for-profit product development
- Support or service contracts
- Join (or create) non-profits or consortia
- Apply for public software grants
- Seek public or corporate sponsorship

Conversations around sustainability usually start in the [community growth](#3-community-growth) or [maturity](#4-maturity) stage, but it's healthier to consider and work towards sustainability in every stage of the life cycle.

### Life Cycle Stages

#### 1. Proposal

An individual or a group identifies a problem that can be solved with software. They either start a new open source tool from scratch, or create an open source equivalent to a proprietary solution.

In this stage, they develop a concrete project proposal by ideating on topics like:

- Scope and goals for the project
- User workflows and comparisons to alternatives
- Software development stack and system architecture
- Development timeline and deliverables
- Resource requirements (contributors and funds)

The project may add more initial authors to the team, look for incubation opportunities, or share the proposal with corporate management to get funds for early development work.

#### 2. Early development

The project enters a rapid development phase to achieve the set goals. Teams usually follow an agile approach to development where they release small-scoped working software and incrementally improve it.

In this stage, initial authors work to:

- Adopt an appropriate OSS license
- Release the first few versions of the project
- Create documentation to onboard new users
- Find early users within the broader community or company
- Author (or adopt) a Code of Conduct and enforcement strategy
- Improve the project quickly based on user feedback

Initial author teams often consist of developers and focus only on quick software development. However, it's equally important to invest in other key areas like user experience and accessibility features to create solid foundations for the long-term usability of the project.

#### 3. Community growth

As the project improves, it attracts more users, followed by more contributors, and eventually, a community begins to develop around the project.

In this stage, contributor teams:

- Set up community forums and community governance models
- Work on community engagement strategies to support the community
- Promote the project broadly at conferences, podcasts, newsletters, and more
- Expand and update the community documentation, especially for various kinds of contributors
- Continue to improve the project based on community feedback
- Continue to make releases in quick succession
- Focus on certain maintenance activities in addition to enhancement tasks

Projects can aim create a welcoming environment for everyone, and work with the community to review and update the roadmap regularly.

#### 4. Maturity

The project reaches a steady state of growth with a dedicated community.

In this stage, the project has:

- A linear or plateaued community growth
- Advocates for the project outside the immediate community
- A regular release cadence and release process
- Several active downstream project
- Maintenance prioritized over feature development

Initial authors and early maintainers can develop symptoms of burnout if the project's contributor community is not healthy. Projects may also look towards financial sustainability options like grants or paid licenses in this stage.

#### 5. Wind-down

The project will eventually experience community stagnation or decline. This can happen after years or even decades for reasons including a newer&faster alternative, user base saturation, or sustianer team burnout.

In this stage, the project winds down activity, and decides to archive, shut down, or transfer the project to a different space for continued maintenance. The team also:

- Updates the project repository, documentation, forums, and more, to indicate the decreased activity and direct new users to alternative spaces
- Works with the community for a graceful transition without major disruptions

It's difficult to recognize when a project has stalled and needs to wind down, but it's important for the sustainability of the broader OSS ecosystem. An explicit decision helps the community adopt better tools and smoothly direct their contribution efforts to other growing projects.
