- Understand why individuals and organizations contribute to open source.

## Why contribute to OSS? üå±

The open source contributors' community is massive, and everyone has their own personal reasons and motivations for being a part of this community. Reflecting on your own motivations and understanding fellow contributors' motivation will help you collaborate effectively. We'll briefly explore common motivations for individuals and organizations to contribute to open source in the following sections.

### Individual contributors

Individuals who volunteer their time to contribute, with no direct monetary compensation for their contributions, form the backbone of the open source community. Numerous open source tools that are critical to our digital infrastructure, are sustained by volunteer contributors. We can understand their motivation to work on OSS by looking at extrinsic and intrinsic factors, all equally valid, that at drive them.

#### Extrinsic motivation

- **Career development**: If you work on proprietary software in day-job, you can contributing to OSS to add public record of your skills to your portfolio. The communities around OSS projects also connect people across domains and organizations, which can help you grow their professional network.

- **Up-skilling**: You can strategically choose OSS projects and tasks that help you develop certain skills. You can learn from fellow contributors who are experts in your area-of-interest, while also making valuable improvements to the project.

- **Recognition**: Creating and/or maintaining popular open source projects makes you one of the experts in that area. There are many examples of OSS domain-expert-contributor's gaining social media following, getting invited to conferences & podcasts, and more. This popularity and influence can often be a good motivator to continue contributing and maintaining the project.

#### Intrinsic motivations

- **Community**: Communities are the life force of open source projects. Brett Canon, a Python Steering Council member once said: "I came for the language, but I stay for the community", a statement that resonates with a lot of contributors in the Python open source community. You may contribute to OSS projects because you like your community of collaborators.

- **Hobby and passion**: Many people find joy, satisfaction, and excitement by working on OSS projects in their free time. Perhaps it's a project they use regularly, they created from scratch, or it's work they find personally rewarding.

- **Responsibility**: Sole or long-term maintainers, or project creators, feel a sense of responsibility toward their open source project, and hence continue to contribute and maintain it.

- **Ideology**: Open source software started as movement. Using and contributing to open source is an identity and way-of-life for many people, and that's at the core of their contributions.

### Organizational contributors

Corporate or non-profit organizations sponsor teams of people to contribute to open source projects, or provide funds directly to the projects' sustainers, or both. They can also have a range of incentives from commercial to philanthropic.

- **Stability**: Companies that have internal tools that rely on community OSS projects, contribute to these upstream OSS project to ensure it's stability and maintenance.

- **Adoption and Sustainability**: Organizations open source their internal projects to grow it's adoption and build a community of users and contributors around it. If the project is hosted publicly, free to use, and open to contributions, it adds trust in the project, and more people are willing to use it, as well as opt-in for commercial services developed around the open source project if any. Moreover, if the company intends to reduce direct investment in the project, the open source community can share maintenance efforts to keep the project active.

- **Efficiency**: It's more efficient to solve certain foundational problems in the open, by collaborating with organizations and individuals in the broader tech community. For instance, open "standards" have wider adoption, allowing tools built with said standard to reach more people. Companies can then focus on more innovative work that builds on these foundations.

- **Software quality and security**: Open source software tools, especially community-driven projects, have high-standards for software development, documentation, and security, compared to internal or proprietary software. Many different people, with different expertise, can contribute and engage with OSS projects, improving it organically over time. This is a strong incentive for companies to build tools in the open. You increase your chances of catching vulnerabilities quickly with more eyes on the project.

- **Talent retention**: Companies enable employees to contribute to OSS to keep them engaged and happy at their job, because the individuals may have strong personal motivation to contribute.

- **Reputation**: Contributing to open source projects can be good for public relations (PR). It can be messaged as a part of their philanthropic initiatives or corporate social responsibility. It shines a positive light and increases user trust in the company.

### üôã Learner question: Do you know why CZI contributes to napari?

We give you a starting point below, but this is something you need to answer with your team.

Napari is a powerful, open source, imaging tool for scientific research. It fits CZI's mission to solve the global challenge of eradicating disease, by investing in science and technology. You can innovate faster and reach more people with an open-source-friendly philosophy.
