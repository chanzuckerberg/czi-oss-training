## Why contribute to OSS? üå±

The open source contributors' community is massive, and everyone has their own personal reasons and motivations for being a part of this community. We'll briefly explore common motivations for individuals and organizations to contribute to open source in the following sections.

### Individual contributors

Individuals who contribute voluntarily, with no direct monetary compensation for their contributions, form the backbone of the open source community. Numerous open source tools critical to our digital infrastructure are sustained by volunteer contributors. We can understand their motivation to work on OSS by looking at extrinsic and intrinsic factors at drive them, and all the reasons are equally valid.

#### Extrinsic motivation

- **Career development**: People who work on proprietary software in day-job sometimes contribute to OSS to have a public record of their skills and add to their portfolio. The communities around OSS projects connect you to people in other domains and organizations, and help you grow your professional network.

- **Up-skilling**: While contributing to OSS, you can choose projects and tasks that help you develop certain skills. You can learn from fellow contributors who may be experts in your area-of-interest, while also making valuable improvement to the project.

- **Recognition**: Creating and/or maintaining popular open source projects makes you one of the expert in the project's area. There are many examples of OSS domain-expert-contributor's gaining social media following, getting invited to conferences & podcasts, and more. The popularity and influence can also be a good motivator to continue contributing and maintaining the project.

#### Intrinsic motivations

- **Community**: Communities are the life force of open source projects. Brett Canon, a Python Steering Council member once said: "I came for the language, but I stay for the community", a statement that resonates with a lot of contributors in the Python open source community.

- **Hobby and passion**: Many people find a lot of joy, interest, and excitement in working on OSS project, where contributing is their hobby. Perhaps it's a project they use regularly or created from scratch, or work they find personally rewarding.

- **Responsibility**: Sole or long-term maintainers or project creators feel a sense of responsibility toward their open source project, and hence continue to contribute and maintain it.

- **Ideology**: Open source software started as an ideology and a movement. Using and contributing to open source is an identity and standard-way-of-life for many people, and that's at the core of their contributions.

### Corporate contributors

Corporate or organizational contributors sponsor teams of people to contribute to open source project and/or provide funding directly to the projects to direct it to relevant contributors. There is often some commercial incentive behind corporate contributions.

- **Stability**: Some companies have internal tools that rely and depends on community OSS projects. They contribute with staff-time of funds to ensure the upstream OSS project stays stable and well maintained.

- **Adoption and Sustainability**: Organization can open source their internal project to grow it's adoption and build a community of users and contributors around it. Having the project hosted publicly, legally free to use, and open to contributions adds a layer of trust in the project, and more people are willing to use it. Companies can then have commercial services around the open source project. If the company has plans to reduce direct investment in the project, open source community contributors can help with the long-term sustainability of the project.

- **Efficiency**: It's more efficient to solve certain foundational problems in collaboration with the broader tech community, in collaboration with other organizations and individuals. The foundational tools can then be used to do more innovative work. For example, having open source standards increases it's adoption, allowing tools built with the standard to then reach more people.

- **Software quality and security**: Open source software tools, especially community-driven projects, have high-standards for software development, documentation, and security, compared to internal or proprietary software. Many different people, with different expertise, can contribute and engage with OSS projects, improving it organically over time. This is a strong incentive for companies to build tools in the open. You increase your chances of catching vulnerabilities quickly with more eyes on the project.

- **Talent retention**: Companies enable employees to contribute to keep them engaged and happy at their job, because the individuals may have strong personal motivation to contribute.

- **Reputation**: Contributing to open source projects can be good PR for companies. It can be a part of their philanthropic initiatives or corporate social responsibility. It shines a positive light and increases user trust.
