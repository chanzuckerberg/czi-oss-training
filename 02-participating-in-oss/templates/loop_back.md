Hi!

As promised, here’s a draft of the public resource I’ve been compiling from the conversation we all had on <**topic**>: <**link**>

It would be greatly appreciated if you could give this a look by <**deadline**>.

Here are a few things to keep in mind as you read:

Please double-check how I’ve credited you or left you anonymous and that it matches your expectation. If this is all you do, and you skip the rest, great!
If, after reading the draft, you want to be added or removed as a named contributor at the bottom, please let me know, and I will make this change.
If you’re interested in making some edits, please do so in suggestion mode.

Thank you so much.
