Hi!

Thanks for participating in <**event name/conversation**> about <**topic**>.
We/I believe that the conversation was very productive, and we would like to share it with the community as a shareable resource.

I am starting by asking everyone who contributed to that conversation for consent and how they'd like to be credited. There is no pressure either way.

Could you take a look at the documented conversation at <**LINK**> and let me know:

    1. Are you comfortable with me sharing an anonymized version of the conversation with the community? (If your answer is yes, you can go to the next question, if not, I won't include anything related to you or what you shared, and you can skip the next question).
    2. Would you like to be named or credited in any way? Let me know which options feel best:
        1. Include your name as a contributor, but do not link directly to any quote or section.
        2. Quote or tag you directly on the document.

Whatever your choice is, I will also be sharing a draft of the document before sharing it to ensure your credit and consent choices are honored.
If you want to work on putting the public resource together with me, proactively let me know.

Thanks again for your participation and for helping us make this a great resource for the community!
