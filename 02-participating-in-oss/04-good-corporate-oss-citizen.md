## Learning Objectives üß†

Corporate contributors have a responsibility to support the volunteer community and work collaborative at every stage, from corporate open source strategy, to team-level sprint planning, to day-to-day individual contributions. This chapter will help you:

- Learn best practices for successful corporate sponsorship and effective collaboration with the project community
- Understand creation new open source projects and contributing to existing projects.

## Familiarize with Community Standards üîñ

All open source contributions start with an understanding of project-specific community standards and processes. This first step is especially important for corporate contributors because you have additional reputation and trust to build within the project community. Taking the time to understand community standards early, and making an active effort to follow them, signals a strong respect for volunteers' time.

These standards are usually documented in the community, developer, or contributor sections of the project's documentation. Corporate-sponsored individual contributors should familiarize themselves with the following non-exhaustive set of guidelines.

- **New contributor guidelines** - The journey, tasks, and tools for your first few successful contributions, including:
  - End-to-end contribution workflow for the project with notes about specific requirements like corresponding issues for all pull requests, a CHANGELOG entry for each pull request (PR), and more
  - Guidelines for creating context-rich issues & PRs and the appropriate process to move the discussions forward, for example, notifying a particular project team
  - Instructions for setting up local or personal development environments, documentation systems, and test infrastructure, along with project-specific helper tools like `pre-commit`
  - Style guides, also known as project-specific preferences, for authoring code, writing documentation, and using design elements
- **Communication guidelines** - Best practices for engaging with fellow community members, including:
  - Various community forums and their primary purpose like support questions, developer discussions, etc.
  - Guidelines for good asynchronous communication, for example, adding relevant context, using jargon-free plain language, expected time to respond, etc.
  - Code of Conduct to follow in the community spaces
- **Active contributor and maintainer documentation** - Guidelines for regular maintenance activities, including:
  - Issue triaging and PR reviewing guidelines, for example, using project labels and bots
  - Release procedure, activities, and cadence
  - Continuous integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows
  - Guidelines for upstream and downstream collaboration
- **Governance** - Decision-making processes in the project as discussed in Module 1, including:
  - Guidelines for creation, comment requests, and final decisions on Enhancement Proposal
  - Notes on project leadership roles and responsibilities
- **Roadmap** - Current project priorities and future direction
