## Learning Objectives üß†

- Learn best practices for successful corporate sponsorship and effective collaboration with the project community
- Understand when and how to create new open source projects, in addition to contributing to existing ones.

## Familiarize with Community Standards¬†üìñ

All open source contributions start with an understanding of project-specific community standards and processes. This first step is especially important for corporate contributors because you have additional reputation and trust to build within the project community. Taking the time to understand community standards early, and making an active effort to follow them, signals a strong respect for volunteers' time.

These standards are usually available in the project's documentation, under the community, developer, or contributor sections. Corporate-sponsored individual contributors should familiarize themselves with the following non-exhaustive set of guidelines.

### New contributor guidelines

The journey, tasks, and tools for your first few successful contributions, including:

- End-to-end contribution workflow for the project and specific requirements like corresponding issues for all pull requests, a CHANGELOG entry for each pull request (PR), and more
- Guidelines for creating context-rich issues & PRs and the appropriate process to move the discussions forward, for example, by notifying a particular project team
- Instructions for setting up local or personal development environments, documentation systems, and test infrastructure, along with project-specific helper tools like¬†`pre-commit`
- Style guides, i.e., project-specific preferences, for authoring code, writing documentation, and using design elements

> **Note:**
> This step can also involve signing a CLA, in which case you should check-in with your management team.

### Communication guidelines

Best practices for engaging with fellow community members, including:

- Various community forums and their primary purpose like support questions, developer discussions, etc.
- Guidelines for good asynchronous communication, for example, adding relevant context, asking specific questions, using jargon-free plain language, expected time to respond, etc.
- Code of Conduct to follow in the community spaces

### Maintenance guidelines

Pathways to become active and regular contributors by engaging in project maintenance activities, including:

- Issue triaging and PR reviewing guidelines, for example, using project labels or bots
- Release procedure and cadence
- Continuous integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows
- Guidelines for upstream and downstream collaboration
- Instructions for supporting project management, community engagement, etc.

### Governance

Decision-making standards and workflows, including:

- Guidelines for creating and discussing Enhancement Proposals
- Recorded project leadership structure, special interest or working groups, member roles and responsibilities, and more

> **Tip:**

### Roadmap

The project's current priorities and future direction, decided with input from the community.

## Build Community Consensus¬†ü§ù

Corporate-backed open source contributors have the expertise and resources to work on large-scoped tasks and can have a significant impact on the project. A key component of this work is building consensus within the community on the design and implementation of these tasks at each stage of your participation: org-level open source strategy, team-level sprint planning, and day-to-day individual contributions.

### Organizational Open Source Strategy

Effective open source collaboration trickles down from the leadership teams. It's easier for individual contributors to build consensus within the community if:

- The proposed tasks are aligned with the open source project's roadmap
- There's transparency around the corporate interest in the task to build community trust
- They have support to contribute to general maintenance efforts, allowing volunteers to participate in the task-specific decisions

### Steps for Large-Scoped Tasks

A large-scoped task is one that touches several parts of the project, impacts a substantial user base, or changes community workflows. Community-governed projects usually have an Enhancement Proposal or Request for Discussion mechanism for making decisions on such tasks:

</p>

When working on enhancement proposals:

- Write the proposal following proper guidelines with all the relevant background and details like implementation plan, alternative strategies, community impact, and more
- Work with 1-2 community members on the draft before submitting for broader community feedback
- Keep an open mind for community feedback and address the questions and concerns thoughtfully
- Make appropriate updates to your proposal based on the community feedback and request a vote only when confident
- Note that sometimes the best strategy to incorporate feedback could be to withdraw the proposal and write a fresh one
- Do not take a rejection personally, but understand the rationale and work with the community on a different plan

This community decision-making and differing points-of-view is how we keep up the quality of our open source projects, so be patient and remember the human behind the screens even when the conversations get difficult. :)

### Considerations for Small-Scope Contributions

Building consensus is also important for day-to-day contributions, which involve fewer stakeholders and a self-driven process. It helps you build trust in the community and make better contributions. Good practices to follow here are:

- Before complete implementations, discuss potential solutions on the issue tracker and open draft PRs for in-depth discussions when necessary
- Actively seek code reviews, or alternative feedback mechanisms for non-code contributions
- Always consider the security and community implications of your work and discuss any concerns on contributor forums
