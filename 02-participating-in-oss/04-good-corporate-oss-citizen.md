## Learning Objectives üß†

- Understand how corporate open source contributions are different from individual and volunteer contributions.
- Learn some strategies and best practices for successful corporate sponsorship, specifically: following community standards, building consensus, keeping stakeholders aligned, and turning private conversation into public resources.
- Reason and make educated decisions about creation new open source projects and contributing to existing projects.

## Understand OSS Contributions üíª

As a corporate-sponsored team or individual contributing to open source software, you are in a position of privilege and power within the community. Therefore, it is your responsibility to support the volunteer contributors and join forces to improve the project, because we need a collaborative contributor community to keep the project healthy.

It may be surprising to first-time OSS contributors, but open source development is usually much slower than corporate projects. Reasons for this include:

- Volunteer contributors can dedicate varying levels of time and energy to the project, because many people have conflicting work and personal responsibilities to balance.
- Community collaborators, often located worldwide, work remotely and communicate asynchronously, so you need to account for time zones and regional holidays while making decisions.
- The high-standards for work and more collaborators means more iteration cycles.

For a successful open source collaboration, make sure to consider this at every stage of your contribution from open source strategy and sprint planning, to day-to-day engagement.

## Familiarize with Community Standards üîñ

The first step in contributing to any open source project is to understand the project-specific community standards and processes. This step is important for all contributors, but especially critical for corporate contributor who have additional reputation and trust to build in the project community as long-term contributors. Taking the time to understand community workflows before starting to contribute signals respect for volunteers‚Äô time.

You can find the community standards in the project‚Äôs documentation under community, developer, or contributor sections. The following is a non-exhaustive list of standards to build familiarity with.

- **Project‚Äôs contribution guidelines:** This resource is intended to guide you start contributing to the project and ensure your first few contributions are successfully incorporated in the project. You will be directed to these guidelines by GitHub or any project resource you encounter as a first-time contributor. These include notes and instructions for:
  - Contribution workflow for the project. For example, some projects require an issue before opening a pull request, a CHANGELOG entry, etc., as a part of the contribution process
  - Issue and PR creation guidelines that share when to open them and what information to include
  - Local or personal setup for development environment, documentation systems, and test infrastructure
  - Project-specific helper tools like pre-commit and linting tools
  - Project‚Äôs code, documentation, and design style preferences (a.k.a. ‚Äústyle guide‚Äù)
- **Community support forums:** Documentation for where and how to ask the project community for help.
  - Appropriate support spaces. Projects may use different platforms for user and developer discussions
  - Communication guidelines around how to ask questions and who to notify, and reasonable wait times
  - Code of Conduct to follow across all spaces
- **Maintainers documentation:** Learn to support the projects maintenance efforts, including
  - Issues and PR triage
  - Guidelines for contributing to upstream and downstream projects
  - Project's release process and cadence
- **Governance:**
- **Roadmap:**
