By the end of this section, you should be able to:

* Describe the ethical, legal, social, economic, and research impact arguments for and against Open Science.

## Introduction to Open Research

Also called Open Science, Open Knowledge, or Open Scholarship, Open Research aims to transform research by making it more reproducible, transparent, reusable, collaborative, accountable, and accessible to society. It pushes for change in the way that research is carried out and disseminated by digital tools.

The [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)](https://www.fct.pt/dsi/docs/Making_Open_Science_a_Reality.pdf) defines Open Science as:

> The practice of making â€œthe primary outputs of publicly funded research results â€“ publications and the research data â€“ publicly accessible in a digital format with no or minimal restriction

As such, it encompasses practices such as Open Access, Open Data, Open Software, Open Educational Resources, Reproducible Science, Co-creation, Public Engagements, and Citizen Science. It also builds and expands on the principles of [FAIR data](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
