* Describe the ethical, legal, social, economic, and research impact arguments for and against Open Science.

## Introduction to Open Research ðŸ”­

Open Research (often referred to as Open Science[^1]) aims to transform the way research is carried out and disseminated. Its primary focus is making research more reproducible, transparent, reusable, collaborative, accountable, equitable, and accessible to society.

[^1]: The term Open Science is often used interchangeably with Open Research. However, Open Research is a more inclusive term that encompasses Open Science and other research practices such as Humanities and Social Sciences.

The [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)](https://www.fct.pt/dsi/docs/Making_Open_Science_a_Reality.pdf) defines Open Science as:

> The practice of making the primary outputs of publicly funded research results â€“ publications and the research data â€“ publicly accessible in a digital format with no or minimal restriction.

To achieve such goals Open Research relies on a number of practices such as Open Access, Open Data, Open Software, Open Educational Resources, Reproducible Science, Co-creation, Public Engagements, and Citizen Science. It also builds and expands on the principles of [FAIR data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)][fair-principles].

The above principles are applied throughout the research lifecycle, from the design of the research question to the dissemination of the results.

### Openness in practice within research


## Open Research and Open Source

The [Open Definition][open-definition] sets out a number of principles that define openness in relation to data and content (including software) and is widely used across Open Research contexts. The Open Definition can be summarized as follows:

> Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose

Additionally, the Open Definition was originally derived from the Open Source Definition and retains many of its principles such as:

* freedom to use, modify, and share
* no discrimination against fields of endeavor, individuals, or groups of people

Additionally, it requires that any content is distributed under an open license compatible with other open licenses (e.g. OSI licenses such as MIT, BSD-3, etc.).
