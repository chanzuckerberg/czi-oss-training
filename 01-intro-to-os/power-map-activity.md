Power mapping is a brainstorming tool used to understand who the key involved parties (a.k.a. stakeholders) are in a given system, and how they are related to each other.
It also helps us identify critical resources within this system as well as the power dynamics between the involved parties.

## Learning Objectives 🧠

After completing this activity you should be able to:

- Identify the key stakeholders in an open source project
- Gain a better understanding of critical stakeholders and resources in an open source project and factors that could disrupt the project
- Generate a power map for an open source project

## Instructions 📝

1. Choose the open source projects you will create the map for. Ideally, this would be a project in which you are already involved in some capacity. If you are not involved in any open source projects, you can choose a project you are interested in or one that you have contributed to in the past.
2. Start by reflecting on these two questions:
   1. Who are the key involved parties in this project? (e.g. maintainers, contributors, users, sponsors, etc.)
   2. What do these parties value? What are the essential resources they need to engage with the project? (e.g. time, money, skills, etc.)
3. Once you've got a feeling for the answer to these questions, begin building your power map. Grab a copy of the [Power Map Template](./oss-power-map.pdf) and fill it out for your chosen project with the following information:

   1. _Key parties involved_: who are the main individuals or groups participating in the project? Depending on its governance structure there might be various layers of stakeholders. Also, make sure to include external or commercial supporters/sponsors.
   2. _Resources_: what are the resources that each of these parties needs to engage with the project? (e.g. time, money, skills, etc.) Are there any resources that are essential to the project's success or sustainability? What resources does each of these parties bring to and value within the project?
   3. _Power and influence_: think about the power dynamics between the different parties. Who has more power and influence over the project? Who has less? What are the factors that influence this power dynamic? Who is responsible for making decisions within the project or relating to the resources identified in Step 2.?
      You can think of power in terms of:

      - Power of resources/budget
      - Human Resources power (including being able to decide on maintainers/contributor status or hiring)
      - Decision-making over strategic direction and priorities
      - Decision-making over ways of working
      - Access to and sharing of knowledge and information

   4. _Disruptors_: are there any factors that would significantly disrupt the project? (e.g. loss of funding, loss of key contributors, etc.)

> **Bonus**
> After completing the power map, reflect on the following questions:
> Who is not present in the project? Who is missing from the map? What are the reasons for this? What are the consequences of this absence?
