There are many different flavours of open source projects and communities, and they all have unique working cultures. In this chapter, an open source "project" refers to the code and documentation repository, and the "community" refers to everyone who interacts with the project.

The most common ways to categorize OSS projects are with licenses and OSS communities are with governance models respectively. These categorizations are inherently coupled, so we'll use "motivation" as an all-encompassing way to categorize different projects and communities.

Learning objectives:

- Have an overview of open source software licenses
- Various approaches to community governance
- Understand motivation behind license and governance choices
