## Format and structure üîñ

This repository contains several modules intended to drive knowledge and culture around open source at CZI.

- Each module covers specific topics and is intended to be self-contained.
- Each module is broken into chapters, prefixed by a number to reflect the order in which they should be read.
- Each chapter indicates the primary personas at which the content is aimed (though this is not prescriptive,
  and all stakeholders involved in open source should be able to follow all the content in this repository).
- Files are written in Markdown format.
- This course is aimed at three primary [learning personas](#learning-personas-Ô∏è); learning paths relevant to each persona are indicated in the [learning personas](#learning-personas-Ô∏è) section of this README.

## Learning personas üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This training is created for three types of people (personas) who interact with open source projects:
code contributors, code-adjacent contributors, and managers who support the first two groups.

You can read the material chapter-wise for a thorough understanding. However, specific chapters are more relevant and valuable for particular personas, and this persona is indicated at the top of each chapter.

The following sections outline each persona's role in the open source project.

### Code contributor üíª

Community members who:

- report issues and create pull requests to improve or maintain the software codebase;
- propose plans to advance the software design and implementation;
- regularly participate in community discussions;
- contribute to upstream or downstream projects where relevant.

### Manager/stakeholder ü§ù

Community members who support teams of regular contributors, specifically:

- manage teams of Individual Contributors (ICs) or advise team members/managers;
- set goals for the team that align with team members' skill sets, the team's mission, and the broader project roadmap;
- track, record, and communicate progress on various tasks;
- participate in community discussions, primarily around project-level strategy and direction.

### Pre-commit hooks üßπ

This repository uses the `prettier` pre-commit hook to standardize our Markdown structure.
To install and run the pre-commit hooks, use these commands from the repository root:

```bash
# install the pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# run the pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Once installed, the hooks should run automatically on every commit.
